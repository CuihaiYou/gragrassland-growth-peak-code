# Grassland Growth Peak Code

## Overview
This repository contains the data analysis code used in the article **"Decadal trends in global grassland growth peaks and their drivers since the 1980s"**.  

The scripts cover the following analyses:  
- **Partial correlation analysis** to examine relationships between key environmental variables.  
- **Factorial experiments** using a **random forest model** to assess the influence of different environmental factors on grassland growth peaks.  

## Contents
- `partial_correlation.R` – Code for partial correlation analysis.  
- `factorial_experiment_RF.R` – Implementation of factorial experiments using the random forest model.  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/grassland-growth-peak-code.git
   cd grassland-growth-peak-code
